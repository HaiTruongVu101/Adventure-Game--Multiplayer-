# Java Adventure Game Project

This is a simple Java game project with a basic structure inspired by [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) on YouTube.

## Project Structure

- `src`: Contains all Java source files.
- `lib`: Contains external dependencies (if any).
- `bin`: Compiled output files are generated here by default.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Place your source files in the `src` folder.
3. Compile your project so that class files are generated in the `bin` folder.
4. Run server.py if you want to play multiplayer mode.
5. Run the main class from the `bin` directory.
